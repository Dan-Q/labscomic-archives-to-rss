# LABS Comic Archives to RSS

Now that the webcomic [LABS](http://www.aaronuglum.com/cartoons/LABS/) has [finished](http://www.aaronuglum.com/LABSmessage.php)
it's a great time to (re-)read the whole thing. Inspired by [a blog comment](https://danq.me/2019/07/24/labs/#comment-169904),
this script screen-scrapes the entire LABS archive in order to generate an RSS feed covering its complete history. Feed this
into your favourite RSS reader and you've got a way to read it all (and track your progress) in your own time.

*There's no need to run this script at all.* Its output can be found at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dan-Q/labscomic-archives-to-rss/master/output.rss - plug that URL into your RSS reader. I've made the code available in case you need to adapt it for some future screen-scraping-to-static-RSS project. For more general-purpose screen-scraping-to-RSS, consider [RSSey](https://github.com/dan-q/rssey).

I do not own the content of LABS (which is copyright Aaron Uglum), just the script that generates this RSS feed (which is released
under the GPL).
