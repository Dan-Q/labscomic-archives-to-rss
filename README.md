# LABS Comic Archives to RSS

Now that the webcomic [LABS](http://www.aaronuglum.com/cartoons/LABS/) has [finished](http://www.aaronuglum.com/LABSmessage.php)
it's a great time to (re-)read the whole thing. Inspired by [a blog comment](https://danq.me/2019/07/24/labs/#comment-169904),
this script screen-scrapes the entire LABS archive in order to generate an RSS feed covering its complete history. Feed this
into your favourite RSS reader and you've got a way to read it all (and track your progress) in your own time.

I do not own the content of LABS (which is copyright Aaron Uglum), just the script that generates this RSS feed (which is released
under the GPL).
